# Groceries App Project

## Overview

i made this project using multiple sources, including,lecture-note, YouTube tutorials,  official React documentation, and materials from  Beyond course. While buildin project, several errors and challenges were encountered,  various online resources were used to address and resolve those issues.

The goal of this README is to explain  overall purpose and structure of  project, document  references used during development, and acknowledge texternal resources that helped shape  final outcome.

## Project Explanation

my  project is a full-stack application built using **React** on tfrontend and **MongoDB** on tbackend. this web application allows users to browse a list of grocery products, add them to a shopping cart, and manage their cart items. The backend is responsible for storing product data and handling CRUD operations.

### Key Features

* Frontend built using React js.
* Multi-page structure with components for product listing, cart management, and navigation.
* State management using React hooks (useState, useEffect).
* Backend integration with MongoDB for data persistence.
* CRUD operations for products (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
* Backend connected to MongoDB with the help of tutorial references.
* Project structured in a modular way with reusable components.
* Error handling and debugging techniques applied throughout development.

### What I Learned

* Setting up a React project from scratch(which was made in project-1).
* Creating and managing React components.
* Using React hooks for state and side effects.
* How to connect React frontend with MongoDB backend.
* Error handling, debugging, and reading documentation properly.
* Using external tutorials and official docs to resolve unexpected issues.
* State management and data flow in React applications.

i got lots of error to connect my mongodb database with the backend. and add CRUD operations. 

### React Documentation

* Official React Website: **[https://react.dev/](https://react.dev/)**

i used  React documentation to clarify concepts, fix component-related issues, and understand React hooks.

### Other Websites & Resources


i used stackoverflow and MDN web docs to resolve issues,which were posted by other developers facing similar problems.
